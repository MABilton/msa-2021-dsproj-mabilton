To deploy the flask_app subfolder onto Heroku via the commandline, first log in to your Heroku account in the commandline:
    heroku login
Next, execute:
    heroku git:remote -a readability-bert
Note that 'bert-readability-mabilton' is the name of our Heroku app (which we created on the Heroku webiste).
After this, we just need to run:
    git subtree push --prefix '[3] Deploy Model/[2] Flask App Deployment/flask_app' heroku master
from the *root directory* of this git repository. After this, we just need to execute:
    heroku open
